        {\emph{Senior Software Engineer, Remote}}
        {\emph{October 2021 -- December 2021}}
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Senior Software Engineer reporting directly to the Vice President of Engineering
        \item Brought onboard to guide the move from an unwieldy monolith to a Spring Boot based
            microservices architecture
        \item Started Bidder, a Spring Boot microservice with reactive Webflux endpoints and functional
            routing for placing bids, extracting those functions from the monolith
        \item Set up CI/CD for Bidder service, automatically building all branches when pushed to Github,
            running all tests, failing the build if any tests fail, triggering Sonarqube analysis, and requiring
            a successful build and passing Sonarqube analysis before merges to master branch
        \item Created Fake-Service, a Spring Boot microservice with REST and Webflux endpoints with random
            delay for load testing
    \end{itemize*}
