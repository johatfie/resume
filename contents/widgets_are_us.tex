    \begin{itemize*}
        \item A microservices project for managing customers, products, and ordering for a warehouse
        \item Built entirely from scratch by myself.  This is still a new project, but I've got all the infrastructure set up to run
            on AWS.  I'm now working on individual microservices that comprise the project.  All source code is viewable
            at the above link to my github repositories.
        \item Hosted on AWS's Elastic Kubernetes Service
        \item Has an Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) stack with Zipkin for logging on a separate EC2 instance
        \item Full CI/CD with Jenkins hosted on another EC2 instance.  Commits pushed to github are automatically picked up by
            Jenkins, built, tested, containerized in a Docker container, pushed to my Elastic Container Registry on AWS, and then
            deployed to Kubernetes running on EKS.
        \item Uses a Spring Cloud Configuration microservice with RabbitMQ to update the configuration settings for running pods
        \item Uses a Netflix Eureka microservice for service discovery
        \item Uses a Spring Cloud Gateway microservice as the API gateway
        \item Includes a Customers microservice for managing customer information that is nearly complete
